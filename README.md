# Read Me

This project is an ugly written python script to convert DIM wishlists (txt) into LittleLight (json) format to review in visual form the DIM wishlist contents.

## To use:
name the input txt file as... 'input.txt' and run `python3 convert.py`

`output.json` will then write to the project directory, you can then upload that to Little Light's website.


## Contributing
My python is ugly, partially because I use it when hacking a quick script together, and partially because I disagree with some python styling as someone from a C++/Java background.

That being said: Please clean up the code as you wish and would like to! It can use the cleanup / improvements.

My only strong preference is for contributors to use camelCasing vs. the_python_underscoring. If this project ends up such that I'm not the one maintaining it, feel free to change the style to whatever the maintainer(s) prefer most.
